    "\n",
    "APIs, or \"Application Programming Interfaces\" are useful because they can allow you to access data or services on other servers on the web. The goal of this tutorial is to give you some experience collecting data from APIs - one way to think of an API is as a URL that returns data when loaded. We'll look specifically at the New York Times APIs. Whenever working with APIs you'll need to get cozy with the API documentation as that will dictate what you can and can't do with the API. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is [the documentation](http://developer.nytimes.com/) on the NYT APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "And here's [the documentation](http://developer.nytimes.com/community_api_v3.json#/README) on the NYT Community API which we'll use to collect a day's worth of comments. "
